Air Dryer

Airbrake is great at reporting errors, but it's not so great at letting you interact with those errors. Air Dryer breathes some life into Airbrake's UI.

1. Installation
---------------

* Open the Chrome Extension file `airdryer.crx` in Chrome. It will prompt you to install the Extension

2. Usage
---------------

* Each error in the Airbrake project view will have a slider to mark it as resolved. They stay on the page after being marked as resolved until you refresh.

Resolve away!
